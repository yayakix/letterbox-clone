// Vite + Express App with Firebase Integration

## General
- You need to go to the firebase website and create a new project. Then add the project's serviceAccountKey to the serviceAccountKey file.
- If you selected yes to the database question: docker is running, it just isn't shown in the terminal
- If a file is in the gitignore but isn't greyed out, try the following:
    1. delete and then retype a letter of the filename in the gitignore, save the gitignore file.
    2. No luck? Reload the developer window.
    3. No luck? The .env is probably in the staging area of git. Unstage it.
    4. Still no luck? Look it up or ask for help. (sorry lol)

- Note that a git repo has been initialized in the root directory of your project!

## Frontend
#### Notes
- If you want to use process.env.[secret], you will need to define it in the vite.config.ts file under where I've defined the API_URL.
- IF USING SHADCN: to add a new component run `npx shadcn-ui@latest add <component_name>`

#### To run frontend:
1. In terminal: npm run dev

#### Firebase
- You need to get your firebase config object from the Firebase console (your project on the firebase website) and add it to the .env file.
- Go look at the .env file to see what variables are needed.

#### To connect to your backend:
1. Add your backend's url to the frontend .env file
2. Add this to your package.json: "proxy": "backend url",

## Backend
#### Notes

- I added a user with auth object to the request object in the backend by declaring it in the global.d.ts file.
  You may need to go into the ./utils/global.d.ts file and delete a line, then add it back in and save the file in order for
  the global type to be recognized.
  
#### To run backend: 
1. Go to package.json
2. Add this script: "start": "nodemon index.ts"
3. In terminal: npm run start

#### To connect to your frontend:
1. In the app.ts file add your frontend's url as an origin in the cors object
